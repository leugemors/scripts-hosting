# Shell scripts
Just some simple bash scripts for my own personal use.
Don't think they will be useful to anyone else, but feel free to take a look.

**dupes**: Find duplicates using MD5 hashes, recursivly starting from the current directory.
**hernoem**: Rename files to lowercase and remove all spaces and other junk.
**list**: Generate a list of all installed packages on my Linux system.
**update**: Script to install all available updates.
**zoek**: Make searching for packages in the repository a bit easier.
**rkl-backup.sh**: My personal backup tool. You will also need `rkl-backup.conf` form the `/etc` directory.

**rkl-config-gcc.sh**
Install all avaialble versions of GCC and update update-alternatives accordingly. Don't ask, but I needed this at some point.

**rkl-firewall.sh**
Enable a basic firewall using `ufw`.

**rkl-git.sh**
Update (pull) all git repos in all sub-directories recursivly.

**rkl-hosting.sh**
Prepare a web hosting server, I still want to convert this to Ansible.

**rkl-imapsync.sh**
Script I used to transfer mail from one mail server to another one.
