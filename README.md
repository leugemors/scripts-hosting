# Shell scripts

Just some simple bash scripts for my own personal use.
Don't think they will be useful to anyone else, but feel free to take a look.

## bin

- **diskfree**: A simple one liner to show the amount of available disk space.
- **dupes**: Find duplicates using MD5 hashes, recursivly starting from the current directory.
- **hernoem**: Rename files to lowercase and remove all spaces and other junk.
- **list**: Generate a list of all installed packages on my Linux system.
- **update**: Script to install all available updates.
- **zoek**: Make searching for packages in the repository a bit easier.
- **rkl-backup**: My personal backup tool. You will also need `rkl-backup.conf` form the `/etc` directory.
- **rkl-config-gcc**: Install all avaialble versions of GCC and update update-alternatives accordingly. Don't ask, but I needed this at some point.
- **rkl-firewall**: Enable a basic firewall using `ufw`.
- **rkl-git**: Update (pull) all git repos in all sub-directories recursivly.
- **rkl-hosting**: Prepare a web hosting server, I still want to convert this to Ansible.
- **rkl-imapsync**: Script I used to transfer mail from one mail server to another one.
- **rkl-install**: Script to install a bunch of packages I like to have on my working machines.

## etc
